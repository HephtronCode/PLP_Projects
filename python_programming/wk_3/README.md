# File Processing Script

This project contains a Python script (`openfile.py`) that performs the following tasks:

1. **Reads a File**: The script prompts the user to enter the name of a file to read. It then reads the contents of the specified file.
2. **Modifies the File Contents**: The script processes the file by converting all text to uppercase and adding line numbers to each line.
3. **Writes to a New File**: The modified contents are saved into a new file named `output.txt`.

## File Structure

1: LINE ONE
2: LINE TWO
3: LINE THREE
4: LINE FOUR
5: LINE FIVE

## How to Use

1. Place the file you want to process in the same directory as `openfile.py`.
2. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python openfile.py
