# File Processing Script

This project contains a Python script (`openfile.py`) that performs the following tasks:

1. **Reads a File**: The script prompts the user to enter the name of a file to read. It then reads the contents of the specified file.
2. **Modifies the File Contents**: The script processes the file by converting all text to uppercase and adding line numbers to each line.
3. **Writes to a New File**: The modified contents are saved into a new file named `output.txt`.

## File Structure

1: LINE ONE
2: LINE TWO
3: LINE THREE
4: LINE FOUR
5: LINE FIVE

## How to Use

1. Place the file you want to process in the same directory as `openfile.py`.
2. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python openfile.py

# Calculate the discount for a given price and discount percentage

## Task
1. Create a function named calculate_discount(price, discount_percent) that calculates the final price after applying a discount. The function should take the original price (price) and the discount percentage (discount_percent) as parameters. If the discount is 20% or higher, apply the discount; otherwise, return the original price.
2. Using the calculate_discount function, prompt the user to enter the original price of an item and the discount percentage. Print the final price after applying the discount, or if no discount was applied, print the original price.
